    "Agent: Hi, my name is Jeff with Cocoran Global Living and I'm calling about the home for sale. Is this the owner I’m speaking with?",
    "Seller (Client): Ah, yes it is",
    "Agent: Perfect, listen, the reason I'm calling is, I work with several buyers or sellers in the area, I'm just wondering is there anything at all I can do to help you?",
    "Seller (Client): No, not at this time. We're not we're not interested in hiring an agent at this point."
    "Agent: Okay, perfect, so not interested in hiring agent at this point…I understand, and when you do sell this home on your own, where would you go next?",
    "Seller (Client): We’re going to LA.",
    "Agent: Okay, perfect, to LA! …And ideally do you have a time frame for when you want to be in LA?",
    "Seller (Client):  Well, we want to be there within the next three to six months.", 
    "Agent: OK, 3 to 6 months. Perfect! So on a scale of 1 to 10, I say your motivation is probably like an 8, would that be accurate?",
    "Seller (Client): Yeah, I mean once we get this home sold, we're going to be moving to LA. So yeah, we need to have the home sold.",
    "Agent: Okay, perfect. So I noticed your ad, what other methods are using to market the home at this time?",
    "Seller (Client): Ah, we're using the ad, we have a sign in the front yard."
